# 01 - OOP Fundamentals

This module covers the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Java.

## Chapters Covered

- Chapter 1: Encapsulation
- Chapter 2: Inheritance
- Chapter 3: Polymorphism
- Chapter 4: Abstraction

## Java Focus Areas

- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Abstract classes vs Interfaces
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Method overloading vs overriding
- `final`, `static`, and `this` keywords

## Key Learnings

- [ ] Understand the four pillars of OOP
- [ ] Know when to use abstract class vs interface
- [ ] Implement composition over inheritance
- [ ] Apply polymorphism in real scenarios

## Practice Exercise

**Model a real-world entity hierarchy:**
- Design a `Vehicle` hierarchy with `Car`, `Bike`, `Truck`
- Implement proper encapsulation and abstraction
- Demonstrate polymorphism with a common `move()` method

## Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between abstract class and interface?
2. Explain method overloading vs method overriding.
3. Why favor composition over inheritance?
4. What is the diamond problem and how does Java solve it?
