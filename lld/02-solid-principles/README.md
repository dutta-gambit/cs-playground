# 02 - SOLID Principles

This module covers the five SOLID principles essential for writing maintainable, scalable code.

## Chapters Covered

| Principle | Full Name | One-liner |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility | One class, one reason to change |
| **O** | Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for base types |
| **I** | Interface Segregation | Many specific interfaces > one general interface |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions |

## Key Learnings

- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- [ ] Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- [ ] Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- [ ] Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- [ ] Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Java Examples to Build

- [ ] SRP: Refactor a `User` class that handles both persistence and validation
- [ ] OCP: Payment processing with multiple payment types
- [ ] LSP: Rectangle-Square problem
- [ ] ISP: Worker interface segregation
- [ ] DIP: Database abstraction layer

## Practice Exercise

**Refactoring Challenge:**
Take a monolithic class that violates multiple SOLID principles and refactor it step by step.

## Interview Questions

1. Can you explain SOLID with a real example from your project?
2. How does DIP relate to Dependency Injection?
3. Give an example of LSP violation.
