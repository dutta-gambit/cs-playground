### 1. What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
A BST has this key property:

- For any node, all values in its left subtree are smaller
- All values in its right subtree are larger
This property makes searching efficient — O(log n) in the best case.


### 2. Why BSTs become unbalanced?

- If you insert elements in sorted order (ascending or descending), the tree becomes skewed like a linked list.
- This destroys the O(log n) search property, making it O(n).

    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4

This is a valid BST but it's essentially a linked list!

Height = 4 (number of nodes)
Search time = O(n) — defeats the purpose of a BST!

### 3. What is a Balanced BST?
A balanced BST is a BST where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1.
This ensures that the tree remains balanced and the search property is maintained.

eg -    2
       / \
      1   3
           \
            4
 - Height = log(N) = log(4) = 2
 - Search time = O(log n)
