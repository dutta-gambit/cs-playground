## Machine learning paradigm

 - Supervised Learning ( models train on labeled data)
    - Classification (predicts class or catagory of a case)
    - Regression (predicts continuous values)
 - Unsupervised Learning ( models train on unlabeled data)
    - Clustering (groups similar data)
    - Association (finds relationships between variables)
    - Anamoly Detection (identifies unusual patterns)
    - Sequence Prediction (predicts next value in a sequence)
    - Dimensionality Reduction (reduces number of variables)
    - Recommendation Systems (predicts user preferences)
 - Semi-supervised Learning ( models train on a mix of labeled and unlabeled data)
 - Reinforcement Learning ( models learn by interacting with an environment)





### Machine Learning Techniques

 - Classification (predicts class or catagory of a case)
 - Regression (predicts continuous values)
 - Clustering (groups similar data)
 - Association (finds relationships between variables)
 - Anamoly Detection (identifies unusual patterns)
 - Sequence Prediction (predicts next value in a sequence)
 - Dimensionality Reduction (reduces number of variables)
 - Recommendation Systems (predicts user preferences)



 ### Classification Vs Regression

 - Classification is used when the output is categorical
 - Regression is used when the output is continuous


 ### Clustering Vs Association

 - Clustering is used when the output is categorical and the data is unlabeled
 - Association is used when the output is categorical and the data is labeled
